### RMS Wray Castle: Why Amateur Radio is important

Technology and Internet culture as we all know has transformed the way most of us live and how we think about places and the past. This super connected world started in many places thanks to many many people and it started in the 19th century. 

James Dawson who built Wray Castle, died in 1875, ten years after James Clerk Maxwell published his proofs of electromagnetism and 20 years before Marconi began commercially exploiting the work of Heinrich Hertz's and others experimentation with "Hertzian waves". In 1894 Oliver Lodge and Alexander Muirhead demonstrated wireless signalling at Oxford Universtiy with Herzian (radio) waves and theres a complex history of experimentation that led to radio being used for communication and safety at sea.

In 1958 Tommy Tomlinson an ex Royal Mail Chief Radio Officer setup RMS Wray Castle to train radio officers for the Merchant Navy and for a while was the key place to learn how to use radio communication and radar at sea. 

I'm interested in the evolution of technical culture; and the stories we tell ourselves about technology; and I think one major myth is that there is this linear story about technological progression: now we have WiFi and the internet books and radio are not important. But it turns out that things don't progress tidily and things we assume are old and new overlap in surprising ways and in surprising places: a Victorian folly in the Lake District does not look like a major player in teaching radio communication

Rather than take a direct historical approach we've invited some people from across the North who in many ways are still teaching radio communication but in the contemporary landscape

Wray Castle is full of surprises and stories but it's difficult to make them like radio waves, visible and it can be difficult to tell them without the people who were there.
