### RMS Wray Castle: Why Amateur Radio is important

Technology and Internet culture has changed the way many of us live and how we think about places and the past; much of the Ok Sparks! project approach is informed by both this and the nature of the site itself. 

In a sense Wray Castle is like an early 'virtual' place; to misquote Proust "real but not actual, ideal but not abstract"; a real fabricated space using the technology of the time but with architecture that refers to visions of the 'idea of a castle' and the imagination of how that would sit in the landscape, complete with fake ruins. 

The connected 'virtual' world we have become used to in the new millenium had it's origins in many places and with many many people but it really started back in the 19th century.

James Dawson who built Wray Castle, died in 1875, ten years after James Clerk Maxwell published his proofs of electromagnetism, predicting radio waves and 20 years before Marconi began commercially exploiting and communicating the work of Heinrich Hertz's and others experimentation with electromagnetic "Hertzian (radio) waves". In 1894 Oliver Lodge and Alexander Muirhead demonstrated wireless signalling at Oxford Universtiy with radio waves and there proceeds a complex but rapid history of experimentation that led to radio being used for communication and safety at sea famously saving the survivors of the Titanic. Without this mix of theory and experimentation, and those early technical cultures, the Information Society we live in may not have developed the way it has.

In 1958 Tommy Tomlinson an ex Royal Mail Chief Radio Officer setup RMS Wray Castle to train radio officers for the Merchant Navy and for a while it was one of the key places to learn how to use radio communication and radar at sea. 

I'm interested in the evolution of technical culture and the stories we tell ourselves about technology. I think one major myth picked up from 'upgrade' culture perhaps, is that there's a linear story about technological progression: now we have WiFi and the internet, books and radio are not important and everything happens in Silicon Valley. 

But it turns out things don't progress tidily and things we assume are 'old' and 'new' overlap in surprising ways and in surprising places: a Victorian folly in the Lake District does not look like a major player in teaching radio communication, but it was.

Rather than take a direct historical approach to Wray Castle's past, we've invited some people from across the North who in many ways continue to teach radio communication but in the contemporary landscape of mobile data communication.

Wray is full of surprises and stories about the science of communication and biology but it's difficult to make them, like radio waves or microscopic algae, visible and understandable.  It can be difficult to tell these stories without people, so part of the Ok Sparks! artwork is to invite some special guests to informally show visitors their interest and passions with the idea that this intimacy gives you a different kind of knowledge. We can all read a fact about a places past; and now that **is** one of the internet's role: but real direct discovery and a conversation, is perhaps worth a hundred Wikipedia entries or github repo's. 

The period of broadcasting is ending at the same time as the internet is poised on the brink of letting people access the sum of all human knowledge, or becoming it's gatekeeer. A mix of potential global sharing and narrow-casting, it's an interesting time for comms. Personalised learning has it's <a href="http://fredrikdeboer.com/2016/03/07/what-thomas-hardy-taught-me/">own dangers</a> of course, we are fed the things we think we want to know about based on what we already know or have looked at, or have shopped for; or worse what other people think we should know based on what we do know or <a href="http://icreacharound.xyz/">have looked at</a>.

The first part of the film above documents an Uplands Mountain Rescue Resilience Project based in Coniston and for me this really represents the kind of knowledge that can get so easily missed.

I think discovering the real texture of some less well known technology, perhaps some of it presumed redundant or of little importance, face to face in a unique place could only help in this world. We have kept this as informal as possible as we believe the context of where knowledge is exhanged should be played with; it's not necessarily in large institutions, it's in a church hall or an old castle, in the tributaries and uplands of the glacially carved landscape, or in the use of early radio isotopes to date a Cumbrian Tarn. 

Before Wray Castle became a place for people to visit, The National Trust, although preserving something along the classic 'country house of import' lines, invited tenants over the years that have truly added to it's stories and I think to the real texture of the cultural heritage of the Lake District. Look beyond traditional tourism and Cumbria is really a place of that much mis-used word, 'innovation': the innovation rhetoric that flies around in politics often overlooks the real nuance of what that means, people in unique places and contexts exploring, be it freshwater science, microbiology, radio communication or text adventure games and Minecraft.
